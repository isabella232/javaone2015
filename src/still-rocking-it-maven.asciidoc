TIP: Hold on tight, this is going to be a wild ride!

== Before We Get Started 
:incremental:

* Maven is opinionated...
* And so are the developers!
* Follow best practices, to make your life easier
* Maven is open source
* Work happens on latest code
* Old releases receive no attention or support 

== Do NOT Use Old Maven Versions

* Maven 1 (doh!)
* Maven 2
* Maven Ant Tasks (based on Maven 2 and unmaintained) 
* Maven 3.0.x (yes, not that one either)
* Maven 3.1.x. and Maven 3.2.x

TIP: Unless you are prepared to maintain those projects yourself, use Maven 3.3.3

== Avoid Other Old Stuff 

Also be careful about

* IDEs using old Maven versions
* Old IDE plugins
* Old Maven plugins
* JDK 4,5,6 and 7 usage

== Now Lets Get Started - Maven Wrapper

No need to install Maven

----
mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper
----

And then just use similar commands to 

----
./mvnw clean install
----

* Unix and Windows scripts
* Automatic download and install of Maven
* Uses ~/.m2/wrapper
* Removes need to provision Maven

== .mvn Configuration

* Project local configuration folder
* Maven 3.3.1+
* Control how project is built
* Extension loading
* JVM configuration

TIP: No more global MAVEN_OPTS because of a specific project's needs.

== Core Extensions

Allow different Maven behavior e.g. 

* Parse pom in different syntax - Polyglot Maven 
* Different behavior for local repo access
* Reactor ordering 
* tbd

== Control Your Tools

Beyond wrapper and .mvn

* Control plugin versions 
** e.g. extend https://github.com/simpligility/progressive-organization-pom[progressive-organization-pom] 
* Use http://maven.apache.org/enforcer/maven-enforcer-plugin/[Enforcer plugin]
** with standard or http://www.mojohaus.org/extra-enforcer-rules/[extra rules]
** or write your own rules

== Extensions Examples

* Concurrent repo access
* Smart builder

== Example Polyglot Maven

links and more

jruby - build example 

snakeyaml

presto


== Maven Shell

tbd

== Takari Lifecycle

tbd

incremental build library

== Incremental Example

Example of to make incremental plugin (antlr build)

== Maven dev tools

Awesome for Maven dev and plugin dev

== Maven Testing Tools and Beyond

test project generator from dot files

proto plugin - archetype replacement - maybe

== Plugin Testing

plugin testing framework including IDE support

== Plugin Testing Examples

Android Maven Plugin and NDK Plugin

== Generations

maybe .. depending on status, at least update what is there and what is coming

== Other Cool Stuff

Docker Maven Plugin from spotify


////
commented out for now.. 
== Best Practice - Repo Manager

* Use a Maven repo manager

* That is open source ;-) 


== Otto

* New pure-play open source repository manager

* Build by Maven users

* For Maven users

* No thrills
/////

== Repository Tools

* maven repository tools
* https://github.com/simpligility/maven-repository-tools

== Eclipse and M2e

* including polyglot extensions from Fred
* Maven dev tools
* Maybe some web app

== IntelliJ

IntelliJ - change request, push Jetbrains 

== Netbeans

??

== Next?
:incremental!:

Join us for a Maven Hangout On Air

* Demo your solution or tip
* Ask your question
* Discuss user questions
* And developer questions

== The End
