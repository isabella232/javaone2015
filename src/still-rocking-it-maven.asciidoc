TIP: Hold on tight, this is going to be a wild ride!

== Before We Get Started 
:incremental:

* Maven is opinionated...
* And so are we!
* If you want to program your own build
* Use Ant
* Or Gradle

WARNING: Hahahahahaha

== Before We Get Started - Once More 

Best Practice - Do NOT use old, unsupported stuff!

* Maven 1 (doh!)
* Maven 2
* Therefore also not Maven Ant Tasks! 
* Maven 3.0.x (yes, not that one either)
* Maven 3.1.x. and Maven 3.2.x
* Old M2e and Eclipse versions
* IntelliJ, Netbeans, ... lots talk about that later

TIP: Unless of course you are prepared to maintain those projects yourself....

== Now Lets Get Started - Maven Wrapper

No need to install Maven

* e.g. on your CI server nodes

----
mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper
----

And then just do 

----
./mvnw clean install
----

or whatever.. 

== .mvn Configuration

tbd

== Core Extensions

tbd


== Control Your Tools

Above controls Maven and config

Next step - control plugin versions - use organization pom like progressive-organization-pom 
 
Use Enforcer plugin

== Extensions Examples

* Concurrent repo access
* Smart builder



== Example Polyglot Maven

links and more

jruby - build example 

snakeyaml

presto


== Maven Shell

tbd

== Takari Lifecycle

tbd

incremental build library

== Incremental Example

Example of to make incremental plugin (antlr build)

== Maven dev tools

Awesome for Maven dev and plugin dev

== Maven Testing Tools and Beyond

proto plugin - archetype replacement - maybe

== Plugin Testing

maybe .. depending on status, at least update what is there and what is coming

== Other Cool Stuff

Docker Maven Plugin from spotify


////
commented out for now.. 
== Best Practice - Repo Manager

* Use a Maven repo manager

* That is open source ;-) 


== Otto

* New pure-play open source repository manager

* Build by Maven users

* For Maven users

* No thrills
/////

== Related tool

* maven repository tools

== Eclipse and M2e

* including polyglot extensions from Fred
* Maven dev tools
* Maybe some web app
